# world_clock

The above named Python application displays the times of the following locations:
  - Berlin, Germany
  - Chennai, India
  - London, U.K.
  - New York City, U.S.A.
  - Los Angeles, U.S.A.
  - Tokyo, Japan

This has been achieved by creating a simple GUI with the library 'Tkinter'. 
Displayed are hours minutes and seconds of the time in a given timezone.
Exact times and timezone adjustments were made possible with the libraries 'datetime' and 'pytz', respectively.

In this repository you will find two files: 'fonts_tkinter.py' — a visualisation of the fonts TKinter has to offer (which are really just system fonts), and 'world_clock.py' — the application itself. Furthermore, you will also find a folder called 'button_files', that has images which are for the buttons in the application.
