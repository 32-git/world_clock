# world_clock

The above named Python application displays the times of the following locations:
  - Berlin, Germany
  - Chennai, India
  - London, U.K.
  - New York City, U.S.A.
  - Los Angeles, U.S.A.
  - Tokyo, Japan

This has been achieved by creating a simple GUI with the libraries Tkinter and CustomTkinter. Displayed are hours minutes and seconds of the time in a given time zone. Exact times and time zone adjustments were made possible with the libraries 'datetime' and 'pytz', respectively.


In this repository you will find a few files and a folder:
  - 'fonts_tkinter.py' — visualisation of the Tkinter fonts (--> system fonts).
  - 'pytz_all-time-zones' — list of all pytz time zones.
  - 'tkinter_colours.jpg' — display of all the Tkinter colours.
  - 'theme.json' - a theme, containing most colours of the objects in the app.
  - 'world_clock.py' — the application itself.
  - 'img' folder — has images which are for various objects in the application.
